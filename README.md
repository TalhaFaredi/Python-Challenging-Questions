# Python String Manipulation and Class Scores Program

## Description
This repository contains Python programs that showcase basic string manipulation, tuple handling, and dictionary operations. The programs also demonstrate the use of loops, conditional logic, and data processing to handle various tasks, such as reversing names, calculating average class scores, and finding specific words in a sentence.

### Tuple Reversal and Sorting

This program processes a list of names in a tuple format and reverses the order of each tuple. The reversed names are then stored in a new list, and the list is sorted alphabetically.

---

### Class Scores Average Calculation

This program calculates the average scores of students across multiple subjects. The data is organized in a dictionary where each class has a list of students and their respective scores. The program iterates through each class and calculates the average score.

---

### Detailed Class Scores

An extended version of the class scores program that prints the individual scores for each student along with the class name. This allows for a more detailed overview of student performance in each subject.

---

### Finding Specific Words in a Sentence

This program checks whether the word "Python" is present in a given sentence. It splits the sentence into words, iterates through them, and prints a message if the word "Python" is found.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run each Python program in your preferred development environment or directly from the command line.
